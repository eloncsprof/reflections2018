Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A folder/directory called .git is created. This folder will keep the meta data of each change committed.

Question: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area holds files that can be committed where working directory holds files that are not ready to be committed. You 
must add a file to the staging area from the working directory before it can be committed to repository.

Question: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can run git diff --staged to see the changes in the staging area that have not been committed yet.

Question: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Keeps multiple different scenarios being integrated into a similar timeline. Helps to identify separate pieces of work until
such time as the separate pieces need to be integrated.

Question: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? Quick snapshot of the branches gives a better sense of who branched and when.
