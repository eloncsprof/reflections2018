Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A folder/directory called .git is created. This folder will keep the meta data of each change committed.

Question: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area holds files that can be committed where working directory holds files that are not ready to be committed. You 
must add a file to the staging area from the working directory before it can be committed to repository.
